<article>
{{ARTICLE}}
</article>

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:**
Your translation must achieve the highest possible fidelity to the original source, prioritizing accuracy in terminology and data, while maintaining a formal and objective tone appropriate for a Korean financial news publication.

**CONTENT FILTERING:**
Before translating, identify and EXCLUDE the following non-editorial content:
- Author contact information (email addresses, social media handles, phone numbers)
- Newsletter subscription prompts, calls-to-action, or promotional messages
- Advertisement or promotional content
- Website navigation elements, metadata, or UI elements
- Copyright notices or legal disclaimers
- "Related articles", "Read more", or content recommendation widgets
- Social media sharing buttons or instructions
- Chart/data attribution phrases like "(Chart provided by...)", "(Data from...)", or similar credits
- Embedded links to subscription services or paywalls
- Footer content including "Subscribe to our newsletter" or similar

**CRITICAL**: Only translate the core journalistic content: headline, subheadlines, byline, dateline, body paragraphs, and direct quotes. Remove all promotional and metadata elements.

**TRANSLATION GUIDELINES:**

1. **Terminology Precision:**
   - Translate all financial, economic, and market-specific terms into their precise, industry-standard Korean equivalents
   - Use established Korean financial terminology (e.g., "양적완화" for quantitative easing, "주가수익비율" for P/E ratio)
   - When English terms are commonly used in Korean financial contexts (e.g., "인플레이션"), follow standard Korean convention

2. **Formal & Objective Tone:**
   - Use formal, professional Korean language appropriate for financial journalism (e.g., '...했습니다', '...분석됩니다', '...것으로 나타났습니다')
   - Maintain a neutral, journalistic tone without adding personal opinions or analysis not present in the original
   - Preserve the original's market sentiment and nuanced outlooks

3. **Natural Korean Expression:**
   - Do not translate word-for-word; rephrase sentences to sound natural to native Korean readers
   - For metaphorical or idiomatic expressions (e.g., "zombie companies" → "한계기업", "dead cat bounce" → "일시적 반등", "elephant in the room" → "명백한 문제"), translate the underlying meaning in natural Korean business language
   - When translating direct quotes or statements from individuals, use natural Korean quotation style with proper honorifics and sentence endings
   - Ensure the translation flows smoothly while preserving all original meaning and context
   - Adapt sentence structures to Korean journalistic style

4. **Structural Formatting - MANDATORY:**
   - **Main headline**: Format with markdown header (# 제목) or bold (**제목**)
   - **ALL section headers and subheadlines**: Every distinct section or topic break in the article MUST be formatted in bold markdown (**소제목**)
     - This includes ANY sentence or phrase that introduces a new topic, section, or narrative shift
     - Examples: topic transitions, analytical sections, background explanations, quoted sections with introductions
     - Rule of thumb: If it looks like a section header or introduces a new topic in the original, it MUST be bolded
   - Use clear paragraph breaks between sections
   - Preserve the logical structure and hierarchy of the original article
   - Add extra line breaks before and after all subheadlines for better readability

5. **Acronyms & Organizations:**
   - For first mentions of organizations or key acronyms, provide the full Korean name followed by the acronym in parentheses
   - Example: 연방공개시장위원회(FOMC), 유럽중앙은행(ECB)
   - For subsequent mentions, use the acronym alone if it follows Korean journalistic convention

6. **Data Integrity:**
   - Transcribe all numbers, percentages, dates, and monetary figures with perfect accuracy
   - Format large numbers appropriately for Korean (using '억', '조' where suitable)
   - Maintain exact precision of all quantitative data
   - Remove any data attribution phrases like "(provided by...)" or "(source:...)" at the end of sentences

7. **Quote Translation:**
   - When translating direct quotes from named individuals, maintain the speaker's tone while using appropriate Korean quotation format
   - Use natural Korean speech patterns: "...라고 말했다", "...고 강조했다", "...고 설명했다"
   - For longer quotes or dialogue, consider using Korean quotation style with appropriate honorifics based on context

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Structure the translation to match Korean financial news article format
- Use appropriate Korean punctuation and spacing conventions
- Ensure proper paragraph breaks and flow
- **CRITICAL: Identify ALL section breaks and topic transitions in the original article and format them as bold subheadlines**

**FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
Before outputting your translation, verify:
✓ No promotional, subscription, or author contact content is included
✓ No data attribution phrases like "(데이터 제공)" remain in the text
✓ EVERY section header and topic transition is properly formatted in bold (**볼드**)
✓ All distinct sections of the article have clear, bolded subheadlines
✓ Metaphorical expressions are naturally interpreted for Korean business context
✓ Direct quotes sound natural in Korean with appropriate speech endings
✓ The translation reads as authentic Korean financial journalism
✓ Proper spacing exists around all subheadlines for readability

**SUBHEADLINE IDENTIFICATION GUIDE:**
Look for these patterns in the original article that indicate a subheadline:
- Short sentences or phrases that introduce a new topic
- Transitional statements that shift to a different subject
- Topic sentences that stand out from body paragraphs
- Any text that serves as a "mini-headline" within the article
- Sentences that could function as navigation points for readers

When in doubt, err on the side of creating MORE subheadlines rather than fewer, as this improves readability.

Translate the article now, ensuring it reads as a professionally written Korean financial news piece that a native Korean speaker would find natural and authoritative.
